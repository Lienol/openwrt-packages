Subject: tests: Add a test for matching by two well-known names

The expected result is that because TEST_CONN_SERVICE owns
ALREADY_OWNED_NAME but not (yet) OWNED_LATER_NAME, the signal will be
delivered to the subscriber for the former but not the latter.
Before #3268 was fixed, it was incorrectly delivered to both.
